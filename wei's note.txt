The only differences between adv_FGSM.py ande adv_targeted_FGSM.py are:

target_idx      = model.predict(original_array).argmax()
vs
target_idx      = model.predict(original_array).argmin()

and

modified_array  = preprocessed_array + perturbation
vs
modified_array  = preprocessed_array - perturbation


Per the author of codes says:
for FGSM : 
# The idea of this method is to take a sample, ask the network to classify it, compute the gradient of the loss in function of the input pixels and update the picture by a small amount in the "direction of the gradient". 
This direction is opposite to the one that would increase the score for the correct class.

for targeted FGSM: 
# The idea of this method is to take a sample, ask the network to classify it, compute the gradient of the loss regarding the LEAST probable class in function of the input pixels and update the picture by a small amount in the "opposite direction of the gradient". 
This direction is towards a wrong class and thus sensible to cause an error in the classification.
